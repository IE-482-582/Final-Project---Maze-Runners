## Project Objective
The maze runner project consists of 2 robot which passes through a maze using the voice commands. The robots will be fully voice controlled and has to pass through the obstacle course without hitting each other or with the walls. In other words, it will contain collision avoidance. The robots will be controlled by 2 different operators that will start the race at the same time and the one to get across first will be the winner.

## Contributions
This project will be really interesting game in which the 2 robots' user will compete each other using their voice command to get across the line first. The voice controlled robots with collison avoidance programmed in them will make for a really good visual representation.


## Project Plan
While controlling the robot should turn 90 degrees right or left according to the controller's wish. By using the blathering library of the python software, we give the voice commands to the robots. The maze will be be designed using the world maker, excel or a 2D CAD software (like AutoCAD or Solidworks). The robot can be set in gazebo, stage ROS or rviz simulator for a great 2D or 3D view. This will be create a great gaming experience for the users.


## Milestones/Schedule Checklist

## Measures of Success
- [ ] View maze world in simulator.
- [ ] Whether the two robots are moving simultaneously.
- [ ] Whether the two robots are following collision avoidance or not.
- [ ] Whether the robots are following the voice commands or not.
- [ ] Have a classmate follow the steps in the README to successfully run the simulation without any help.
