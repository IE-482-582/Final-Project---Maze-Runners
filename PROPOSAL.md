## Project Objective
The maze runner project consists of 2 robot which passes through a maze using the voice commands. The robots will be fully voice controlled and has to pass through the obstacle course without hitting each other or with the walls. In other words, it will contain collision avoidance. The robots will be controlled by a single operator who will command the robots by name and the robots will move simultaneously on his/her command.

## Contributions
This project will be really interesting for the operator to observe how multiple robots move around the space and experiments with robots their speed, accelration, turning ability and order the robots to compete with each other which will be really fun. The voice controlled robots with collison avoidance programmed in them will make for a really good visual representation and will act as a fail-safe for the robots in case the voice regonition fails.


## Project Plan
While controlling the robot should turn 90 degrees right or left according to the controller's wish. By using the blathering library of the python software, we give the voice commands to the robots. The maze will be be designed using the world maker, excel or a 2D CAD software (like AutoCAD or Solidworks). The robot can be set in gazebo, stage ROS or rviz simulator for a great 2D or 3D view. This will be create a great experience for the user.

## Measures of Success
- [x] View maze world in simulator.
- [x] Whether the two robots are moving.
- [x] Whether the two robots are controlled simulatneously.
- [x] Whether the two robots are following collision avoidance or not.
- [x] Whether the robots are following the voice commands or not.
- [x] Have a classmate follow the steps in the README to successfully run the simulation without any help.
